			<h1 id="about">About us and our mission</h1>
			<p>Grup 2, integrated by four seventeen year-old students from Binissalem, Mallorca, has been created with the aim to achieve the CanSat project goals, endorsed by the ESA (European Space Agency). Looking forward to developing an efficient prototype, our main interest is learning during the procedure. From coding a suitable structure, to designing and constructing a functional design, every piece of work has been precisely calculated for an adequate suiting to the proposed conditions.</p>

			<p>Within this project, two important clauses are to be fulfilled. Two different missions, two distinct projects: both in a can-sized structure, and yet both willing to impress.</p>

			<h1>Current progress on the project</h1>
			<p>The CanSat project is currently still work in progress.</p>
			<p>We are actively working on finishing and refining our first prototype, which will be presented and assessed at the campus of the University of the Balearic Islands in March.</p>

			<h2>Technical details</h2>
			<p>We are currently drafting our first preliminary report, in which we will provide an outline of our work to the date.</p>
			<p>The report is expected to be finished and released a the end of February 2023.</p>

			<h1>Support us</h1>
			<p>At the moment, we are searching for sponsors who can assist us with purchasing all of our necessary components. In exchange, sponsorers will be able to use the parachute or the satellite's body for advertisement and promotion.</p>
			<p>If you work for a company that might be interested, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>. We would love to get in touch!</p>
